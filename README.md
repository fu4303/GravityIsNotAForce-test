I'm experimenting with how to visualise the geodesics in spacetime under general relativity. Please help with suggestions!

- 2020-11-01: Added [more complex view](https://timhutton.github.io/GravityIsNotAForce/constant_gravity_4d.html) tackling the cases of 2+1 and 3+1 with constant-gravity.

History of the ideas: (please help fill in the gaps!)
- 1985: The book [Relativity Visualized](https://books.google.de/books?id=lwZBAQAAIAAJ) by Lewis Carroll Epstein shows how [bending spacetime can make straight lines out of parabolas](http://demoweb.physics.ucla.edu/content/10-curved-spacetime).
- 2001: [Rickard Jonsson](http://www.relativitet.se/) publishes [a paper](http://www.relativitet.se/Webarticles/2001GRG-Jonsson33p1207.pdf) that tackles the issue quantitatively.
- 2013: A [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0QN6f3G4) animates the parabolas idea, citing Epstein's book.
- 2014: A [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I) by Edward Current showed a physical 'spacetime stretcher'.
- 2019: A [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ab08f5/pdf) by Magdalena Kersting references that youtube video and commends the approach to educators. A [follow-up paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ab56d7/pdf) discusses the limitations of the model.

TO-DO list:
- Is the 1+1 approach used (the parabolic axes in the inertial frame drawn on the right) in any way correct or rigorous?
- Can we extend to 1+1 with a varying gravitational field (e.g. from Earth's surface to Moon's orbit)? [[See an experiment here]](https://timhutton.github.io/GravityIsNotAForce/variable_gravity.html) Or with a point mass on the 1D line (a black hole)? [Rickard Jonsson](http://www.relativitet.se/) has a [3D embedding](http://www.relativitet.se/Webarticles/2001GRG-Jonsson33p1207.pdf) that does the job.
- Can we extend to 2+1 with a point mass? Perhaps by considering a single geodesic (e.g. an elliptic orbit) as a straight line and drawing the rest of the universe as a (possibly very strange) distorted grid around that geodesic?
